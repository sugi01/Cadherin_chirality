This repository contains code used in “Chiral cadherin flow and extracellular matrix break left–right symmetry of cytokinesis during embryogenesis” (Khor et al.).

A Jupyter notebook includes an HMR-1 distribution simulator with user-tunable control parameters.

Monte Carlo simulation code is provided to reproduce Figure 4E.

Parameters for mutant conditions are listed in the Supplementary Information (Table S1).
